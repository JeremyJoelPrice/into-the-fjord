title: Carrying Gear
---

You have 10 slots for gear, and this includes each of your hands.  
Most items take 1 slot, **bulky** things take 2, **weightless** things don't
take any.

Some things are bundled together into 1 slot.  
_(e.g. 100 coins, or 3 trail rations)_

You can push yourself to use an 11th slot, but:

-   your [Guard](/rules/fighting/guard) stays at 0
-   you stagger around slowly
-   you incur [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue) **immediately** when you put something
    down  
    _(since Fatigue also occupies a slot,_  
    _you must drop two things to function normally again)_
