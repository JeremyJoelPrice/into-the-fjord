**TIP** for players: When telling the Guide what you want to do, describe what
you do or say as well as the outcome you want. _"I lean in close and threaten to
break the guard's legs if he doesn't let us through, my hand hovering over my
axe"_ is much better than _"I persuade the guard to let us pass"_. **a)** It's
more evocative and entertaining! **b)** Giving the Guide specific information
helps them decide if a roll is needed. A clever or creative approach can mean
you don't have to leave it up to chance!

### Chapter ideas?

The Guide begins the game while the players figure out what they want to do.

They players konw their goal, and encounter an obstacle.

The players plan, and ask the Guide good questions.

The players declare their actions, and try to avoid making assumptions or
describing outcomes.

The rules kick in, and there are consequences.

The players remind themselves of their plan and their goal, and consider whether
retreat would be prudent.

The players find a clever way to press on, and win the day!
