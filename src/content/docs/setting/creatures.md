title: Creatures

Below are some creatures you can use.

Use **Will** for morale/panic during a fight.

The **Honour** stat represents how honest, loyal and courageous a creature is.  
Use it semantically, you probably won't need to roll Honour for anything. This
is in place of a player's Reputation (to emphasise  
how they'll actually behave rather than how they're percieved).

## Creature List

### Angel

> His body [...] was like the beryl,  
> and his face as the appearance of lightning,  
> and his eyes as lamps of fire,  
> and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass,  
> and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
>
> Daniel 10:5–6

Matthew 28:3 – Angel at the tomb: “His countenance was like lightning, and his
raiment white as snow.”

Revelation 10:1 – “Another mighty angel [...] clothed with a cloud, a rainbow
was upon his head, his face was as it were the sun, his feet as pillars of
fire.”

#### Cherubim

Ezekiel 1:4–11 (Vision of the Cherubim / “living creatures”): Four living
creatures, each with four faces (man, lion, ox, eagle). Each had four wings.
Their feet were “straight feet,” soles like a calf’s foot, “sparkled like the
colour of burnished brass.” Hands of a man under their wings. They shone like
burning coals/lamps.

Ezekiel 10:12 – “Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their
wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about.”

#### Seraphim

Isaiah 6:2–3 (Seraphim): Each had six wings: with two covered the face, two
covered the feet, two used to fly. They cried “Holy, holy, holy.”

#### Ophanim

Ezekiel 1:15-21

> 15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by
> the living creatures, with his four faces.  
> 16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a
> beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was
> as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.  
> 17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when
> they went.  
> 18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their
> rings were full of eyes round about them four. 19 And when the living
> creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were
> lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.  
> 20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to
> go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the
> living creature was in the wheels.  
> 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when
> those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against
> them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.

### Worm King

A dead body being puppetted by 10,000 maggots.  
They coordinate as a hive mind, and throw their eggs onto you.  
Once hatched, the maggots burrow into your skin and slowly take control of your
body.  
After a week, you are completely under their control.  
If they forget to make you eat, you die.

    Arm:1 Grd:4 Mgt:12 Grc:6 Wil:12 Hon:Terrible
    Punch (d4), throw eggs (Grc to avoid)

### Draugr (Undead)

A body which has died, and been reanimated.

It can't be killed, or it already has been.  
Bleeding, poisoning, suffocating and puncturing will have no effect.

But it still needs eyes to see, and you can hack it to pieces.

**Attacking Specific Bodyparts** is possible once its Guard reaches 0:

-   Players roll damage against a chosen body part
-   Draugr rolls Might
-   If the Might roll fails, or the bodypart has taken over 5 damage overall,  
    it is severed and acts independently

**Removing the head** will render the head & body as independent creatures.

-   The head has a Fair (+0) chance of an intact voicebox, and can still bite.
-   The body will continue it's previous action while trying not to get
    destroyed,  
    but will lose coordination until it's crawling around randomly.

**Cremating** undead works best, but:

-   Building a fire consistently hot enough for several hours is a specialist
    skill.
-   The draugr will actively try to escape the entire time.

#### Behaviour

-   They ritualistically repeat old behaviours, to no purpose.
-   They gradually forget everything, and physically decay.
-   Eventually they become inert, until a snack wanders into their mouth.

A draugr who **feeds** on human flesh or blood:

-   Becomes addicted, and craves more.
-   They become lucid, intelligent, and seemingly perfectly alive.
-   They also absorb the personality & qualities of their victims.
