title: Attacks & Damage
---

When attacking a target:

1. The attacker rolls their weapon's damage dice.

2. The target subtract's their [Armour](/rules/fighting/armour) from this
   amount.

3. The remainder reduces the target's [Guard](/rules/fighting/Guard).

4. When Guard is 0, any remainder reduces the target's
   [Might](/rules/ability-scores)  
   & they must **roll** Might using their new score.

**SUCCESS** means you're still standing.  
**FAILURE** means you're [Wounded](/rules/fighting/wounds) & cannot continue
fighting.

**_Example_**  
_The shieldmaiden Grimhild attacks a berserker, rolling **d8** for her sword._  
_She rolls a 6. The berserker has 1 Armour, so 5 damage is dealt to him._  
_The berserker's Guard is 3, so it is reduced to 0,_  
_and the remaining 2 reduced his Might from 14 to 12._  
_The berserker rolls Might and gets 13: he's wounded, and goes down._

## Special Attacks

-   Attacks made form a position of advantage are **empowered**, and roll a d12
    for damage
-   Likewise, **impaired** attacks roll a d4
-   When **ganging up** on one target, all attackers roll damage and **only the
    highest** roll counts
-   **Area** attacks affect multiple targets; roll damage **separately** for
    each
-   To **disarm** or **trip** an opponent, their **Guard** must be 0.  
    When you next attack them, deal no damage.  
    Instead they roll **Grace** to not fall/drop their weapon.
