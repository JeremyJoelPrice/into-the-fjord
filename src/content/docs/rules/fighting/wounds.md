title: Wounds
---

You are wounded when you fail your **Might** roll (see
[Attacks & Damage](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage/)),  
which means you can only crawl around until you get help & rest.

But if your attacker rolled the **maximum value** on their damage dice,  
you receive a different wound depending on how much Might damage you took:

1-2  
A lucky hit knocks you out.  
Next round roll Might to wake up.  
Roll 1d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new max.

3-4  
A heavy blow leaves a lasting scar.  
Roll 1d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new max.

5-6  
Your flesh is torn apart and blood soaks your clothes.  
You gain a [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue) until you get a full night's rest.  
Roll 2d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new max.

7-8  
Fractured bones leave you semi-conscious.  
You are [Deprived](/rules/deprivation) until you get a full night's rest.  
Roll 3d6; if it's higher than your max Grace, it becomes your new max.

9-10  
Your guts are hanging out, your wakefulness flickers.  
Deprived & crippled until you get a full night's rest & a skilled healer.  
Roll 3d6; if it's higher than your max Will, it becomes your new max.

11-12  
Roll 1d4\*:

|     |          |     |           |
| --- | -------- | --- | --------- |
| 1   | Left Arm | 2   | Right Arm |
| 3   | Left Leg | 4   | Right Leg |

This limb is chopped off, crushed, or rendered useless.  
You need immediate help or you'll bleed to death.  
Increase your Will by 1d6.

\*If your character is four-legged or winged, roll 1d6 when choosing a limb.
