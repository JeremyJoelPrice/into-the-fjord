title: Galdr
---

_See [Galdr Spell List](/rules/magic/galdr-spell-list) for spells._

Galdr is the more respectable magic, as opposed to
[seiðr](/rules/magic/seiðr/),  
and is mainly performed by chanting & singing.

It is loud, frenzied, and challenges nature to submit to the caster.

Performing galdr incurs [Fatigue](/rules/fighting/fatigue), and you need to:

-   use a loud voice
-   be awake & alert, with steady footing
-   hold a
    [galdr staff](/character-creation/gear-tables#specialist--cultural-items),
    or have a **perfect** memorisation, of the desired spell

If you're missing any of these things,  
or if you attempt to **change** how a spell works,  
roll Will to avoid a **misfire**.
