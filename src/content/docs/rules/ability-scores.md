Your character's Ability Scores represent how well they **avoid** harm,  
and how much harm they can **endure** before falling unconscious or dying.

## Rolling Abilities

Roll 1d20 and get a number **equal to or below** your Ability Score to succeed.

A result of **1** always succeeds, a **20** always fails.

## Opposed Rolls

If and your opponent are **both at risk**,  
then you both roll.

The winner is whoever succeeds by a **greater** margin.  
If it's a tie, whoever has the **larger score** wins.

## Advice For The Guide

Ability Rolls only happen when you call for them.  
You have to decide three things:

-   [Is time for a roll](#when-to-roll)?
-   [Which Ability should be rolled](#which-ability-to-roll)?
-   What's the [difficulty & danger](#difficulty--danger) of what the players
    are attempting?

Always **tell your players** what you decide,  
so they know the stakes before they act.

### When To Roll

-   If there is a clear source of danger, **AND**
-   If the danger is neither inevitable nor trivially avoidable, **AND**
-   If the players lack either the **time**, **gear**, or **skill** to
    methodically avoid it

...then it is a good time to roll.

### Which Ability To Roll?

This depends on what the player is doing to avoid the danger.  
_The ability you roll to avoid danger does not have to_  
_be the same ability which gets harmed by it._

-   If they use strength, speed, or their sheer toughness to endure the harm,
    it's **Might**.
-   If they use precisely coordinated movements or quick reflexes, it's
    **Grace**.
-   If they use their force of will or concentrations, it's **Will**.

### Difficulty & Danger

The more **difficult** a task is, the **less you achieve** when you succeed.  
The more **dangerous** a task is, the **more it costs** when you fail.

This is crucial for the Guide to understand, so consider the following example.

---

Three players want to climb a **treacherous cliffside**.

-   The **difficulty** is the size of the cliff, and how climbable its face is
-   The **danger** is getting injured by falling

Suppose the players are able-bodied & have climbing gear,  
but are forced to rush because there are enemies nearby.

-   One enemy is at the top of the cliff, and pours **oil** down onto Player A
-   A second enemy waits below with a spear, ready to **impale** Player B if
    they fall
-   Player C wears a pair of **spiked boots**, to make climbing easier

Here's one way you might handle this as the Guide:

**PLAYER A** is covered in oil. This makes the climb more **difficult**, but not
more **dangerous**.  
**Success**: only make it halfway up the cliff, and must roll again to
continue.  
**Failure**: the painful fall.

**PLAYER B** gets stabbed if they fall. This makes it more **dangerous**, but
not more **difficult**.  
**Success**: reach the top.  
**Failure**: they get hurt once for the fall, and once again for the spear.

**PLAYER C** has spiked boots. This makes it less **difficult**, but no less
**dangerous**.  
**Success**: speed to the top, with enough time to act again before the enemies
can.  
**Failure**: the painful fall.
