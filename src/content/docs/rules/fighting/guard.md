title: Guard
---

**Guard** is your ability to block, dodge, and otherwise avoid an attack.  
It is reduced by each attack, and once it reaches 0 you're in real danger.

Losing Guard might look like:

-   a near miss
-   an enemy forcing you back
-   psychological pressure

Your Guard is effectively 0 anytime you can't actively defend yourself:

-   when distracted
-   when overencumbered
-   when unaware of the danger that harms you  
    _(even if your guard is up with respect to some other danger)_
