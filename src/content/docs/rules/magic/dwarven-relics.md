title: Dwarven Relics
---

The dwarves made many wondrous gifts for the gods, such as Thor's hammer
Mjölnir.  
More relics have been found in their abandoned halls, and are highly prized.

**Black Candle**  
Think of an emotional memory while lighting this candle;  
that emotion is contagious to all who feel its heat.

**Dinner Spoon**  
Anything eaten with this humble wooden spoon will be harmless & nourishing.

**Far-seeing Ring**  
Looking through this band magnifies things.  
Natural unsteadiness of the hand costs detail at long distances.

**Feathered Cloak**  
Wearer can take the form of an eagle.

**Fixed Rope**  
On command, this rope is fixed in place with the strength of 9 men.  
Loses its power if cut.

**Gale Bladder**  
This sheep's bladder consumes bad weather & high wind to release later with
double the force.  
If used in still air, it will empty lungs & snuff fires.

**Golden Apple**  
When eaten, you are immediately healthy, warm, well-rested & one year younger.

**Gripping Gloves**  
Get a firm hold on the sheerest surface.

**Hel-Horn**  
When sounded over a corpse or a gravesite;  
the deceased returns as an after-walker.  
The target, and Hel herself, find this annoying & inconvenient.  
Ends when the after-walker chooses to return to their grave.

**Pocket Ship**  
When empty of cargo & crew, this ship folds away into your pocket.

**Returning Weapon**  
Strikes true & returns to your hand when thrown.

**Song-Key**  
This crystal captures a sound to release later as physical force.  
Many Dwarven doors can only be opened by the correct sound  
_(e.g. the battlecry of a Valkyrie)_

**Sun Mirror**  
A hand mirror which reflects light with 9 times the intensity.  
Made for lighting undergroud halls using embers,  
they don't reflect heat or other sun mirrors.
