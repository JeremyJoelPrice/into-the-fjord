## 2. Ability Scores

Your Abilities are:  
**Might** - muscle power, metabolism, and endurance  
**Grace** - precise, agile movements, and automatic reflexes  
**Will** - composure, willpower, and acting first in a chaotic situation

_see [Ability Scores](/rules/ability-scores) for more info_

Roll [3d6](/start-here/introduction#dice) to generate each score. Assign each
score to whichever Ability you prefer.

If your character is the child of your previous character, Keep their highest
Ability score and generate the other two.

## 3. Guard

Roll 1d6 to generate your Guard.

Guard is how well you defend yourself in a fight.  
It is depleted when you take damage, and recovers quickly.  
_see [Guard](/rules/fighting/guard) for more info_

## 4. Gift

Your character is gifted in some way.  
You may choose from the following options:

-   Roll or choose a **Skill**;, then write it on your character sheet with a
    "+2" next to it
-   A companion: a raven or a thrall or something else
-   2 random
    [Galdr staves](/character-creation/gear/#specialist--cultural-items)
-   [Prophecy](/rules/magic/seiðr#prophecy)

## 5. Gear

Every character starts with:

-   50 silver pieces (weightless)
-   3 trail rations (1 slot)
-   1 torch (1 slot)

Then:  
**EITHER** roll 2d10x10 for additional silver,  
**OR** select a pre-defined [Kit](/character-creation/kits).

Then:  
**IF** your highest Ability score is less than 12, roll 2d10x10 for additional
silver.  
**IF** your Guard is **1 - 3**, gain a free piece of armour.  
**IF** your Guard is **4 - 6**, gain a free weapon of d6 damage.

**Finally** you have the chance to spend your silver using the
[Gear Tables](/character-creation/gear-tables).

## 7. Finishing Touches

Give your character a Reputation of "Mediocre (0)".

Write down a short description of your character.  
Consider things like:

-   Your physical appearance
-   Your ambitions
-   How you normally respond to challenges
-   Your core beliefs & loyalties
-   How ruthless vs honourable you are

## 8. Twist of Fate (Optional)

A stroke of good or bad luck happened to you.

If your highest Ability score is less than 10, you may roll 1d10 on the Twists
of Fate table.  
Otherwise, roll 1d20.
