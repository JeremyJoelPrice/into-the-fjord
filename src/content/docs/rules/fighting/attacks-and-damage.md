title: Attacks & Damage
---

When attacking a target:

1. Attacker rolls their weapon's dice to get their **damage**.

2. Target subtracts their [Armour](/rules/fighting/armour) from the damage.

3. Target subtracts their [Guard](/rules/fighting/Guard) from the remaining
   damage.

4. When their Guard is 0, any remaining damage reduces the target's
   [Might](/rules/ability-scores)  
   & they must **roll** Might using their new score.

**SUCCESS**  
You're still standing, and able to keep fighting.

**FAILURE**

-   You go down and cannot continue fighting.
-   You need urgent help, otherwise there's a Poor (-1) chance you'll survive.
-   If the attacker rolled maximum damage, you also recieve a
    [Wound](/rules/fighting/wounds).

**Example**  
_The shieldmaiden Grimhild attacks a berserker, rolling **d8** for her sword._  
_She rolls a **6**. The berserker has 1 Armour, so **5** damage is dealt to
him._  
_The berserker's Guard is 3, now reduced to 0,_  
_and the remaining **2** reduced his Might from 14 to 12._  
_The enemy rolls Might and gets 13: he's hurt and goes down._

## Special Attacks

-   Attacks made form a position of advantage are **empowered**, and roll a d12
    for damage
-   Likewise, **impaired** attacks roll a d4
-   When **ganging up** on one target, all attackers roll damage and **only the
    highest** roll counts
-   **Area** attacks affect multiple targets; roll damage **separately** for
    each
-   To **disarm** or **trip** an opponent, their **Guard** must be 0.  
    Then, use your action to force them to make a Grace roll.  
    On failure they fall, or drop their weaopn nearby.
