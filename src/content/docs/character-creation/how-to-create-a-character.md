## 2. Ability Scores

**Might** - muscle power, metabolism, & endurance  
**Grace** - precision, agile movements, & reflexes  
**Will** - strength of mind, composure, & acting first in a chaotic situation

Roll [3d6](/start-here/introduction#dice) to generate each score.  
Assign each score to whichever Ability you prefer.

If your character is the child of your previous character,  
keep their highest Ability score and generate the other two.

_see [Ability Scores](/rules/ability-scores)_

## 3. Guard

Roll 1d6 to generate your Guard.

Guard is how well you defend yourself in a fight.  
It is depleted when you take damage, and recovers quickly.  
_see [Guard](/rules/fighting/guard)_

## 4. Gear

Every character starts with:

- 50 silver pieces (weightless)
- 3 trail rations (1 slot)
- 1 torch (1 slot)

Then:  
**EITHER** roll 2d10x10 for additional silver,  
**OR** select a pre-defined [background](/character-creation/backgrounds).

Then:  
**IF** your highest Ability score is less than 12, roll additional silver
(2d10x10 again).  
**IF** your Guard is **1 - 3**, gain a free piece of
[armour](/character-creation/gear-tables#Arms--Armour).  
**IF** your Guard is **4 - 6**, gain a free
[d6 weapon](/character-creation/gear-tables#Arms--Armour).

**Finally** you have the chance to spend your silver using the
[Gear Tables](/character-creation/gear-tables).

## 5. Gift

Your character is gifted in some way.  
You may choose **one** of the following options:

- Roll or choose a [Skill](/rules/skills), then write it on your character sheet
  with a "Great (+2)" next to it
- A companion: a raven, a thrall (servant), etc.
- 2 random
  [Galdr staves](/character-creation/gear-tables#specialist--cultural-items)
- The power of [Prophecy](/rules/magic/seiðr#prophecy)

## 7. Finishing Touches

Give your character a [Reputation](/rules/reputation) of "Fair (+0)",  
unless your kit already established this.

Write down a short description of your character.  
Consider things like:

- Your physical appearance
- Your ambitions
- Your beliefs & loyalties
