title: Guard
---

**Guard** is your ability to block, dodge, and otherwise avoid an attack.  
Once it reaches 0 you're in real danger, but it recovers quickly.  
_(see [Resting & Healing](/rules/resting-and-healing/))_

Losing Guard might look like:

-   a near miss
-   an enemy forcing you back
-   psychological pressure

Your Guard is effectively 0 anytime you can't actively defend yourself:

-   when distracted (e.g. drinking a potion during a fight)
-   when [overencumbered](/rules/carrying-gear/)
-   when unaware of the danger that harms you  
    _(even if your guard is up with respect to some other danger)_
