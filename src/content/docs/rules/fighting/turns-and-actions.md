title: Turns & Actions
---

When a fight breaks out, we take **turns**.

-   Players who succeed a **Will** roll go first
-   Then all opponents act
-   Then **all** players act

Continue alternating sides until the fight is over.

## Actions

On the players' turn, you each take **one** action,  
plus any supporting actions or movement.

Your characters act **simultaneously**,  
all dice are rolled after **everyone** commits to an action.

Example actions:

-   attacking someone with a weapon
-   create space between yourself & an attacker
-   fishing a potion out of your backpack, and drinking it

## Space & Movement

A rough map is helpful for keeping track of a fight,  
but exact distances don't matter.

Instead think in broad terms like:

-   **Within reach**, if you can reach out and touch them
-   **Near**, if you can approach & attack them as one action
-   **Far**, if you can't approach & attack, but can still shoot them
-   **Distant**, if a ranged weapon can't reach them
