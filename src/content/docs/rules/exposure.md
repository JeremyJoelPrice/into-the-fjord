## Exposure

When a character is exposed to cold temperatures,  
decide how cold it is and check the corresponding **interval**.

|           temperature | interval |
| --------------------: | -------- |
|      Cold (0º to 10º) | 3 hours  |
| Freezing (-10º to 0º) | 1 hour   |
|   Deadly (below -10º) | 1 minute |

After the first interval you become [Deprived](/rules/deprivation).  
After every subsequent interval you take **1d6 Grace** damage.

- At [0 Grace](/rules/ability-scores) you can no longer move; unless rescued,
  you'll die in 1d8 hours.
- If you have a winter cloak, you are 10º **warmer**.
- If you're wet or undressed, you are 10º **colder**.
