title: Wounds
---

Wounds are nasty, but you come back stronger.

They happen when an attacker rolls maximum damage & you fail your Might roll.  
Lookup the Might damage you took below.

**Reocvery** time varies, but generally requires **bed rest** and a **skilled
healer**.

**1-2**  
_A lucky hit knocks you out._  
Next round roll Might to wake up, otherwise an ally must wake you.  
Once awake: roll 1d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new
max.

**3-4**  
_A heavy blow leaves a lasting scar._  
You're down & need help; Poor (-1) chance you'll recover on your own.  
On recovery: roll 1d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new
max.

**5-6**  
_Your flesh is torn apart and blood soaks your clothes._  
You gain a [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue) until you get 1 week of rest.  
On recovery: roll 2d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new
max.

**7-8**  
_Fractured bones leave you semi-conscious._  
You are [Deprived](/rules/deprivation) until you get 1 week of rest.  
On recovery: roll 3d6; if it's higher than your max Grace, it becomes your new
max.

**9-10**  
_Your guts are hanging out, your wakefulness flickers._  
Deprived & crippled until you get 1 month of rest.  
On recovery: roll 3d6; if it's higher than your max Will, it becomes your new
max.

**11-12**  
Roll 1d4\*:

|     |          |     |           |
| --- | -------- | --- | --------- |
| 1   | Left Arm | 2   | Right Arm |
| 3   | Left Leg | 4   | Right Leg |

_This limb is chopped off, crushed, or rendered useless._  
You need immediate help, then 2 weeks of rest.  
On recovery: increase your Will by 1d6.

\*If your character is four-legged or has wings, roll 1d6 when choosing a
limb.  
\*\*If your character is a snake, the end of their tail is chopped off.
