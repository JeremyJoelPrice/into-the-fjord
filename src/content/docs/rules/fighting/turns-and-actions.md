title: Turns & Actions
---

When a fight breaks out, we start taking **turns**.

-   Players who succeed a **Will** roll go first
-   Then all opponents act
-   Then **all** players act
-   Continue alternating until the fight is over

Skip the Will roll if one side takes the other by surprise,  
just have them go first and then alternate as normal.

## Actions

On the players' turn, you each take **one** action,  
plus any supporting actions or movement.

Your characters act **simultaneously**, so coordinate your actions together.  
**All** dice are roll after **every** character commits to an action.

Example actions:

-   attacking someone with a weapon
-   disengaging from an enemy & creating space between you
-   fishing something out of your backpack

**Avoid** drinking a potion or rummaging in your backpack during a fight:  
You [Guard](/rules/fighting/guard) is effectively 0 if you take your eyes off
your opponent!
