title: Turns & Actions
---

When a fight breaks out, we start taking **turns**.

-   Players who succeed a Will roll go first
-   Then all opponents act
-   Then **all** players act
-   Continue alternating until the fight is over

Skip the Will roll if one side takes the other by surprise,  
just have them go first and then alternate as normal.

## Actions

On the players' turn, you each take **one** action,  
plus any supporting actions or movement.

Player characters act **simultaneously**.  
**All** dice are rolled after **every** player has commited to an action.

Example actions:

-   attacking someone with a weapon
-   disengaging from an enemy & creating space between you
-   fishing something out of your backpack
-   running to a door, unlocking it with a key, opening it, and running through

**NOTE** when fighting an enemy, you don't want to take your eyes off your
opponent.  
Drinking a potion or fetching an item from your backpack drops your
[Guard](/rules/fighting/guard) to 0!
