-   Healing an injured ally
-   Crafting a magical weapon
-   Training a beast to serve you

As a player, you can't make many tactical or creative decisions  
when a task requires specialist knowledge & skill.

Instead, use a [Fate Roll](/start-here/how-to-play/#fate-roll) to see how well
your character performs.

The bonus to your roll is probably Fair (+0) or worse, unless you have
training.  
_(Trained a skill is a good goal for characters to pursue)_

## Example

_Helga wants to reach an island, and avoid pirates on the way._  
_Helga is Great (+2) at sailing, and has a ship with a ready crew._

_The Guide asks for a Fate Roll._  
_She rolls 2d6 and gets 5, +2 for her skill makes 7: success!._  
_Her ship arrives safely._

## Skill List

|                                       |
| ------------------------------------- |
| Fine Crafts (jewellery & lock making) |
| Healing                               |
| Herbalism                             |
| Hunting & Trapping                    |
| Navigation & Wayfinding               |
| Poetry & Music                        |
| Sailing                               |
| Ship-Building & Carpentry             |
| Smithing                              |
| Train Animal                          |

This is not a complete list, because a skill can be anything.  
The only rule is that skills are tasks which are not possible through
[normal play](/start-here/how-to-play/) because:

-   there are no tactical decisions for the players to make
-   there are no opportunities for creativity / self-expression
-   the task requires domain knowledge which the players & Guide may lack

## Skilled Hirelings

You always have the option to hire skilled NPCs to travel with you.  
They have some trade-offs:

-   PRO: They generally succeed without needing a Fate Roll,  
    unless they're in danger
-   PRO: They are generally Excellent (+3) or better at their specialty  
    _(because they're not good at much else)_
-   CON: They need feeding & protecting
-   CON: As non-combatants, they tend to flee from danger
