None of this is necessary to run the game.

## History of Norðland

Most people arrived here after fleeing from the tyrant _Harald Stormcrown_.  
The volcanic ashlands and frost-bitten tundras make most parts uninhabitable,  
but the free people get by seeking safety and a little prosperity.

## Religion & Mythology

Norðlandrs revere the **Aesir**, a mythical family called "the gods".  
The **Jötnar** are another family, joined with the Aesir by marriage &
friendship,  
but divided by rivarly and war.

The difference is the Aesir look kindly upon humans.

### The Main Gods

**Odin** - a god for the upper class. Wise, bloodthirsty, and ambitious.  
He decides the outcomes of battles, and recruits slain warriors for his own
army.

**Thor** - a god for the common people. Strong, brave, and true of heart.  
He is the Aesir's greatest warrior, and thunder is the sound of his hammer
striking true.

**Frigg** - a goddess, the wife of Odin. Magical, prophetic, and a symbol of
motherhood.  
She knows the future and the wise listen.

### Other Important Beings

**Loki** - one of the Jötnar. Loki is a liar, a coward, and a troublemaker.  
Though he is Oden's blood-brother, at Ragnarök he will betray the gods.

**Hel** - one of the Jötnar, she claims the dead left by Odin.  
At once alive and dead, Hel is the gatekeeper of the grave. She rules a frosty
realm below.

**Jörmungandr** - a serpent so large he encircles the earth.  
His every movement shakes the ocean and floods the land. He is the equal of
Thor.

**Fenrir** - a giant wolf betrayed by the gods.  
He is a son of Loki, and the reason Odin is raising an army.

**The Norns** - mysterious beings who carve the fates of all into the bark of
Yggdrasil, the World Tree.

## Beyond Norðland

To the south there are 9 warring kingdoms.  
They all claim loyalty to the _Church of The Light_, and they all provide
tribute and soldiers.  
The _City of Asculum_ is the seat of the Church, and spreads The Light through
faith, coin, & bloodshed.

These southern lands are more developed: they have steel, castles of stone, and
occult magicks.  
They have even brought new dangers to Norðland: vampires, witches, demonic
possessions.  
But their people are smaller and weaker than the Norðlandrs, and they don’t
bathe as often.

There are many more lands not yet discovered...
