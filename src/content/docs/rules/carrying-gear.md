title: Carrying Gear
---

You have 10 slots, and most things take 1.  
Bulky things take 2, weightless things take 0.  
Some things are bundled together into 1 slot.

You can push yourself to use 11 slots, but:

-   your [Guard](/rules/fighting/guard) is 0
-   you can only stagger around slowly
-   you incur [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue) **immediately** when you put something
    down
