"Enough!" you cry.

For years you've worked hard, paid your tribute, and obeyed the law.  
But things keep getting worse.

Monsters take the livestock.  
Invaders spread a new faith.  
Neighbours plot while farms fail and bellies empty.

No one is coming to save you.  
It's time to take life into your own hands.

**Into the Fjord** is about self-determination & human connection in a bleak &
callous world.

To be played with:

-   👥 friends
-   ✏️ 📄 pencils & paper
-   🎲 standard RPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, & d20)

ð = th as in "the"
