A skill is anything your character can do that isn't supported by
[normal play](/start-here/how-to-play/) because:

-   there are no tactical decisions for the players to make
-   there are no opportunities for the players to be creative or express
    themselves
-   the task requires domain knowledge which the players and the Guide may lack

Examples include:

-   brewing an antidote
-   crafting a magical weapon
-   spending a few hours scavenging for food

Skills are resolved with a [Chance Roll](/start-here/how-to-play/#chance-roll).

The Guide can provide in-game opportunities to learn skills.

## Example Play

_Helga wants to reach an unexplored island, and avoid any pirates on the way._  
_Helga is Good (+2) at sailing, and has a ship with a ready crew._

_The Guide asks for a Chance Roll._  
_She rolls 2d6 and gets a 5 on the dice._  
_Adding the +2 bonus for her skill gets a 7._

_This is below 8, so something's gone wrong!_  
_As the island comes into view, Helga hears war drums beating,  
and a crewmember shouts "Pirates approaching!"_

## Skilled Hirelings

You always have the option to hire skilled NPCs to travel with you.  
They have some trade-offs:

-   They succeed without needing a Chance Roll,  
    unless they're in danger
-   They are generally Great (+3) at their specialty,  
    because they're not good at much else
-   They need feeding & protecting
-   As non-combatants, their morale might fail in dangerous situations

If you enjoy planning for what you'll need and managing an entourage, then use
hirelings.  
If you prefer to invest in one character and improve them over time, then learn
Skills.  
Choose or combine these approaches as you prefer.
