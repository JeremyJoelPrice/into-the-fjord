title: Guard
---

**Guard** represents you actively defending yourself.  
Block, parry, dodge, and otherwise avoid a **gruesome injury**.  
You can't get hurt unless your Guard is 0.

Losing Guard might look like:

-   a near miss
-   an enemy forcing you back
-   psychological pressure

Your Guard is effectively 0 anytime you can't actively defend yourself.  
Such as:

-   when overencumbered
-   when unaware of the danger that harms you  
    _(even if your guard is up with respect to some other danger)_
