“Enough!” you cry.

For years you've worked hard, paid your tribute, and obeyed the law.  
But life kept getting worse.  

Monsters take the livestock. Invaders spread a new faith.
Neighbours whisper and scheme while farms fail and bellies empty.

Honour is a luxury when people are desperate,  
so now it’s up to you to fight, endure, and take life into your own hands.


**Into the Fjord** is about self-determination & human connection in a bleak &
callous world.

To be played with:

-   👥 friends
-   ✏️ 📄 pencils & paper
-   🎲 standard RPG dice (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, & d20)
