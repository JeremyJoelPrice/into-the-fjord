title: Guard
---

**Guard** is your ability to avoid harm with skill, instinct, and a little
luck.  
Losing guard means you havenâ€™t been hurt yet, but it's getting closer.

The Guide may describe losing Guard as:

-   a near miss
-   psychological pressure
-   any other way in which the enemy is closing in

Your Guard is effectively 0 anytime you can't actively defend yourself.  
Such as:

-   when overencumbered
-   when unaware of the danger that harms you  
    _(even if your guard is up with respect to some other danger)_
