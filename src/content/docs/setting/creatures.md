Roll **Will** when a creature might panic/lose morale in a fight,  
for example:

- when they start losing a fight
- when their first ally falls
- when their leader falls

**Honour** represents how honest, loyal and courageous a creature is.  
**Failure**: they do the selfsih thing.

## Creature List

### Bear

##### Brown Bear

    Grd:6 Mgt:15 Grc:13 Wil:5 Hon: Poor (-1)
    claws (2d8) bite (d10)

##### Polar Bear

    Arm:1 Grd:12 Mgt:18 Grc:10 Wil:9 Hon:Poor (-1)
    claws (2d12) bite (2d6)

### Draugr (Undead)

A body which has died, and been reanimated.

**Mindless Draugr**

    Arm:1 Grd:3 Mgt:15 Grc:5 Wil:- Hon:n/a
    fists (1d6), faulty axe (d6), faulty helmet

**Lucid Draugr Warrior**

    Arm:2 Grd:6 Mgt:16 Grc:9 Wil:10 Hon:Grim (-2)
    fists (1d6), axe (d6), helmet, shield

It can't be killed, for it is already dead.  
Bleeding, poisoning, suffocating and puncturing will have no effect.

**Attacking Specific Bodyparts** is possible once its Guard reaches 0:

- Players roll damage against a chosen body part
- If the Draugr fails a **Might** roll, or the bodypart has taken **5 damage**
  overall,  
  it is severed or destroyed

**Removing the head** will render the head & body as independent creatures.

- The head has a Fair (+0) chance of an intact voicebox, and can still bite.
- The body will continue it's previous action while trying not to get destroyed.

**Cremating** undead works best, but:

- Building a fire consistently hot enough for several hours requires special
  training.
- The draugr will actively try to escape the entire time.

#### Behaviour

- They ritualistically repeat old behaviours, to no purpose.
- They gradually forget everything, and physically decay.
- Eventually they become inert, until a snack wanders into their mouth.

A draugr who **feeds** on human flesh or blood:

- Becomes addicted, and craves more.
- They become lucid, intelligent and self-aware.
- They absorb the personality & qualities of their victims.
- Assuming their victim has a moral compass, they inherit this and are horrified
  by themselves.  
  Many opt to starve themselves back to mindlessness, and can get trapped in
  this loop forever.

### Exile

Below are the regulars, but anyone may be found among exiles.

##### Bandit

    Arm:1 Grd:3 Mgt:12 Grc:6 Wil:8 Hon:Grim (-2)
