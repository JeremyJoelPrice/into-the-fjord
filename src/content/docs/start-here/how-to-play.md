One player is the **Guide**:

-   Provide a scenario to play
-   Adjudicate according to what seems fun & reasonable,  
    and what the rules say (in that order)
-   Describe the dangers & hazards which oppose the players

Everyone else plays a character:

-   Your characters all know each other, and work together as a team
-   Create your characters using
    [How To Create A Character](/character-creation/how-to-create-a-character)

Then you all get together and **play**!  
_See [Example Of Play](/start-here/example-of-play)._

**Normal play** is a conversation which goes like this:

-   The Guide describes the situation, and asks: _"What do you do?"_
-   You can ask the Guide questions, and receive helpful answers
-   Tell the Guide what you do
-   The Guide might ask you to roll some dice
-   Finally, the Guide describes the outcome of your actions,  
    how the situation has changed, and then it's back to: _"What do you do?"_

The Guide will develop a knack for **montages**:  
Briefly describe the boring times,  
resuming normal play when things get good.

## Dice Terminology

-   "2d6" means two 6-sided dice are rolled and added together
-   Likewise 1d20, 3d6, etc.
-   **Except**: 2d6^ means you count the highest die only

### Push Roll

-   roll 2d6 + a bonus
-   8 or higher succeeds
-   7 or lower is either a **failure**, or success at a **cost** (Guide's
    choice)
-   if both dice match, the result is **extreme**

Used for [Skills](/rules/skills),
[Reputation](/rules/reputation-and-relationships), and anything too abstract for
normal play.

| +1    | Fair        |
| 0     | Mediocre    |

See something described in terms of Good (+2), Poor (-1), etc?  
Use a Push Roll to test for success.
