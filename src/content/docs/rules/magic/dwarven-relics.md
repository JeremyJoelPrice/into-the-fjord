title: Dwarven Relics
---

The dwarves made many wondrous gifts for the gods, most notably Thor's hammer
Mjölnir.  
More relics have been found in their abandoned halls.  
These are highly prized, and worth a lot of silver to the right people.

**Black Candle**

all who feel its warmth feel your emotion from that memory.

Light this candle, and you'll feel the emotions of all who feel its warmth.

**Dinner Spoon**

double the force.  
If used in still air, it will empty lungs & snuff fires.

**Gripping Gloves**

**Hel-Horn**

the deceased returns as an after-walker.  
The target, and Hel herself, find this annoying & inconvenient.  
Ends when the after-walker chooses to return to their grave.

**Pocket Ship**  
When empty of cargo & crew, this ship folds away into your pocket.

**Returning Weapon**

**Song-Key**
