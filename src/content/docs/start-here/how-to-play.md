title: How To Play
---

One player is the **Guide**:

-   Provide a scenario to play
-   Describe the dangers & hazards which oppose the players
-   Adjudicate based on what's fun, what's reasonable,  
    and what the rules say

Everyone else plays a character:

-   Your characters all know each other, and work together as a team
-   Your job is to answer the Guide's question: "What do you do?"
-   See
    [How To Create A Character](/character-creation/how-to-create-a-character)

**Normal play** is a conversation which goes like this:

-   The Guide describes the situation, and asks: _"What do you do?"_
-   You can ask the Guide questions, and receive helpful answers
-   Tell the Guide what you do; you are now committed
-   The Guide might ask you to roll some dice
-   Finally, the Guide describes the outcome of your actions,  
    how the situation has changed, and then it's back to: _"What do you do?"_

The Guide will develop a knack for **montages**:  
Briefly describe the quiet times, resuming normal play when things get
interesting.

_See [Example Of Play](/start-here/example-of-play)._

## Rolling Dice

We use dice to represent uncertainty, chaos, and luck in the shared fictional
world.  
The terminology is straightforward:

-   "2d6" means two 6-sided dice are rolled and added together
-   Likewise 3d6, 2d8, d20 (short for "1d20") etc.

There are **three** kinds of dice roll we make during play.

[**Damage Rolls**](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage/) are used when a
character attacks someone with their weapon.  
[**Ability Rolls**](/rules/ability-scores#rolling-abilities) are used any other
time a character tries to avoid direct harm.  
[**Fate Rolls**](#fate-roll) are a catch-all for any other time a roll is called
for.

### Fate Roll

-   roll 2d6 + a **bonus**
-   7 or higher **succeeds**
-   below 7 either **fails**, or succeeds at a **cost** (Guide's choice)
-   if both dice match, the result is **extreme**

The Guide should use their judgement to set the chance of success.  
Think about the fiction first:  
Do the players have a _Good_ chance of finding a poison specialist in town,  
or does it feel more like a _Fair_ chance?  
Pick the description that resonates, and apply its bonus to the Fate Roll.

| bonus | chance to succeed |
| ----- | ----------------- |
| +3    | Excellent (92%)   |
| +2    | Great (83%)       |
| +1    | Good (72%)        |
| 0     | Fair (58%)        |
| -1    | Poor (42%)        |
| -2    | Grim (28%)        |
| -3    | Terrible (17%)    |
