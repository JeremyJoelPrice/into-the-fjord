title: Ability Scores

Your character's Ability Scores represent how well they **avoid** harm,  
and how much harm they can **endure** before falling unconscious or dying.

| Ability | Represents                                                     | Is Reduced By                                        | At 0 You Are |

## Rolling Abilities

When the Guide asks you to roll an Ability,  
roll **1d20** and compare the result to your score.

If your score is **equal** or **higher** then you succeed.  
If your score is **lower** then you fail.

Rolling a **1** is lucky, and guarantees success.  
Rolling a **20** is unlucky, and you fail even if your score is 20 or higher!

## Opposed Rolls

If you're opposing an NPC and you're **both at risk**,  
then you both roll the relevant Ability.

The winner is whoever succeeds by a **greater** margin,  
or in case of a tie, whoever has the **larger score** wins.

## Advice For The Guide

It's up to you which character rolls which Ability and when.  
You have to decide three things:

-   Is time for a roll?
-   Which Ability?
-   What's the **difficulty & danger** of the plan the players have come up
    with?

Always **tell your players** what you decide; they should know what's at stake
before they act.

### When To Roll

-   If there is a clear source of danger
-   If the danger is neither overwhelmingly inevitable nor trivial to avoid
-   If the players lack the **time**, **gear**, and **skill** required to avoid
    it  
    _(danger is often urgent, so time is usually lacking)_

### Which Ability To Roll?

This depends on the nature of the danger.

-   If it rips, tears, or bludgeons the muscles, skeleton or organs, it's
    **Might**.
-   If it disrupts the body's coordination or complex systems, it's **Grace**.
-   If it attacks the mind or how the victim percieves the world, it's **Will**.

### Difficulty & Danger

The more **difficult** a task is, the **less you achieve** when you succeed.  
The more **dangerous** a task is, the **more it costs** when you fail.

This is crucial for the Guide to understand, so consider the following example.

---

Three players want to climb a **treacherous cliffside**.

-   The **difficulty** is the size of the cliff, and how climbable its face is
-   The **danger** is getting injured by falling

Suppose the players are able-bodied & have climbing gear,  
but are forced to rush because there are enemies nearby.

-   One enemy is at the top of the cliff, and pours **oil** down onto Player A
-   A second enemy waits below with a spear, ready to **impale** Player B if
    they fall
-   Player C meanwhile dons a pair of **spiked boots**, to make the climb easier

Here's one way you might handle this as the Guide:

**PLAYER A** is covered in oil. This makes the climb more **difficult**, but not
more **dangerous**.  
**Success**: only make it halfway up the cliff, and must roll again to
continue.  
**Failure**: the painful fall.

**PLAYER B** gets stabbed if they fall. This makes it more **dangerous**, but
not more **difficult**.  
**Success**: reach the top.  
**Failure**: they get hurt once for the fall, and once again for the spear.

**PLAYER C** has spiked boots. This makes it less **difficult**, but no less
**dangerous**.  
**Success**: speed to the top, with enough time to act again before the enemies
can.  
**Failure**: the painful fall.
