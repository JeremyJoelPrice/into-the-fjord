Here's what you need to know to run **Into The Fjord**'s default setting of
Norðland **today**.

## What Is Norðland?

A fictionalised Iceland where survival is tough.  
Norðland has sweeping fjords, hot springs, & lush valleys.  
But also volcanic eruptions, frozen tundras, and dark woods filled with danger.

## Who Are The Player Characters?

They _were_ simple farmers scraping by.  
But they were in an unfair and ultimately futile situation.  
Now they have reached their breaking point,  
and embraced ambition and self-determination.

## What Is Society Like?

Norðland is a formal, diverse, and violent Iron Age society.  
Here are some intuitions to help make it click:

###### Social Structure

-   The family, or clan, is the social unit, and most settlements have a single
    ruling clan
-   Social classes:
    -   Jarls are the wealthy class, with "_The_ Jarl" being the ruler of a
        settlement
    -   Karls are the self-sufficient generalists & tradespeople
    -   Thralls are the lower class of servents, prisoners, and the disgraced

###### Individuals Over Institutions

-   People are loyal to individual rulers, not "the crown" or "the country".
-   People drink & socialise at the market or at someone's hall; there's no
    public tavern.
-   Trades are practiced by families, not guilds.

###### No Bureaucracy

-   Silver is valued by weight. Coins aren't minted, just a standard weight.
-   No mayor, no town guard; the _jarl_ publicly presides over legal disputes.
-   The injured party is expected to enforce the punishment personally.

###### Speech Over Writing

-   Send a messenger, not a letter.
-   Laws, contracts, genealogies & poems are all memorised.
-   Writing is intimate & informal; used for graffiti, memorials, and magic
    rituals.

###### Gangster-Style Politics

The jarl (mob boss):

-   is feared & respected
-   uses diplomacy to avoid a full-blown blood feud
-   but hasn't got the luxury of letting insults go unchallenged.

Now imagine they were elected to this role,  
and are held to the same code of honour as everyone else,  
and now you're in the right zone!

### Code Of Honour

Everyone (including you) is held to this code.

###### Don't Be A Coward

-   introduce yourself, state your business plainly, resolve matters publicly
-   avenge any harm or insult done to you or your clan
-   never resort to gossip, lying, ambush or trickery

###### Deal Fairly

-   keep your word because oaths are sacred
-   be careful challenging those of a different social status than you:
    -   Punching up is bold but risky; you might be dismissed as arrogant
    -   Punching down is safe but shameful; you might be seen as a bully

###### Show Hospitality

-   provide food & shelter to someone who asks for it
-   good guests arrive with a token gift, and never stay too long

## What's Going On?

Here are some sources of drama and conflict the players can get involved in.

###### Dwarven Megastructures

Below ground lie the cathedral-like stone halls of _Niðavellir_, carved by the
dwarves.  
Guarded by automata & nameless monsters below, filled with
[relics](/rules/magic/dwarven-relics) & artistic masterpieces.  
The dwarves hid every entrace so they'd be undisturbed. Some say the dug all the
way to [Hel](/setting/norðland-in-detail/#other-important-beings).

###### Invaders

The Holy Asculum Empire wants to replace all cultures with worhsip of _The
Light_.  
First they sent priests in good faith, now their _Endless Army_ of crusaders and
exoricsts is arriving.  
Bishops plot within fortress-churches, where they interrogate & baptise
captives.

###### Kings & Jarls

The ruling class often hires mercenaries to deal with existential threats to the
settlement,  
strangers & schemers among the settlers, and their own Shakespearean dramas.  
They pay well, but it's messy politics: alliances are fragile and you often must
choose a side.

###### The Wilderness

A pressing & constant threat, used to intensify or complicate other conflicts.  
Exposure, disease, toxic plants & venomous animals, shifting glacial plans &
volcanic eruptions.  
Settlements are small and travel is unavoidable, so the wilderness impacts
everyone.

###### Exiles

Honourless scavengers/bandits with short life expectancy can cause all kinds of
problems.  
They can be anyone and can possess interesting items stolen from travellers.

###### Mythical Creatures

Werewolves, trolls, giants, serpentine dragons, and more.  
They act according to their nature, and usually want an easy meal or to protect
their lair.  
Any horror-movie-esque monster you wish to include can be explained as a child
of [Fenrir](/setting/norðland-in-detail/#other-important-beings).

###### Viking Warbands

Exploring new lands for trade, raids & adventure.  
Some are institutions, their members famous celebrities.  
Raiders always need replacing, or you could get a ship of your own.
