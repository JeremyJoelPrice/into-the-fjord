### Angel

> His body [...] was like the beryl,  
> and his face as the appearance of lightning,  
> and his eyes as lamps of fire,  
> and his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass,  
> and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.
>
> Daniel 10:5–6

Matthew 28:3 – Angel at the tomb: “His countenance was like lightning, and his
raiment white as snow.”

Revelation 10:1 – “Another mighty angel” “clothed with a cloud, a rainbow was
upon his head, his face was as it were the sun, his feet as pillars of fire.”

#### Cherubim

Ezekiel 1:4–11 (Vision of the Cherubim / “living creatures”): Four living
creatures, each with four faces (man, lion, ox, eagle). Each had four wings.
Their feet were “straight feet,” soles like a calf’s foot, “sparkled like the
colour of burnished brass.” Hands of a man under their wings. They shone like
burning coals/lamps.

Ezekiel 10:12 – “Their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their
wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about.”

#### Seraphim

Isaiah 6:2–3 (Seraphim): Each had six wings: with two covered the face, two
covered the feet, two used to fly. They cried “Holy, holy, holy.”

#### Ophanim

Ezekiel 1:15-21

> 15 Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel upon the earth by
> the living creatures, with his four faces.  
> 16 The appearance of the wheels and their work was like unto the colour of a
> beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was
> as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.  
> 17 When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when
> they went.  
> 18 As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their
> rings were full of eyes round about them four. 19 And when the living
> creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were
> lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.  
> 20 Whithersoever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to
> go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the
> living creature was in the wheels.  
> 21 When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when
> those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against
> them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.
