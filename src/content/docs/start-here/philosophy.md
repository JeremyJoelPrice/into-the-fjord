## A Note About Character Death

Death is permanent, and never far away, so get all players are on the same page
about taking risks:

-   Some players are protective of their characters and enjoy when they thrive &
    succeed
-   Some players drive their characters like a stolen car, embracing chaos &
    consequences
-   Some players treat their characters as just a game token to be used
    carefully & tactically
-   Some players want to see their character's personality & flaws influence the
    story

These are **all valid**, and you don't have to choose one.  
Just be aware of what each other prefers, and have fun **together**.

## As A Player You Should Care About:

-   **Having A Plan**  
    Why are you here? What do you want out of this situation? When will it be
    worth retreating instead of pushing ahead? Be intentional.

-   **Gear**  
    What you carry determines what you can do, but space is limited.

-   **Non-Player Characters (NPCs)**  
    Everyone has something useful to offer, or a connection to someone who
    does;  
    however, they will put their own goals above yours.

## As The Guide You Should Care About:

-   **Neutrality**  
    It's ok for the players to have a triumphant win or a crushing defeat.  
    Never punish the players, but be true to the world, it's NPCs, and the whims
    of the dice.

-   **Giving Information**  
    Fun comes from tricky situations, not from player ignorance.  
    Always give them useful answers, a free clue, and telegraph danger

-   **NPCs**  
    Play each monster and person according to their desires & ability to get
    what they want.

## How To Think About Gear

Your gear is everything your character is carrying.  
It's for to **solving problems** in **creative** or **clever** ways.

Get into this mindset by thinking of items in terms of what they **are**, not
what they're **for**.  
For example, a **cooking pot**:

-   may smell faintly of food
-   is noisy when struck
-   can withstand high temperatures

These qualities can be useful in many situations unrelated to cooking.

Examples:

-   check if a surface is sloped by filling a cooking pot to the brim and
    setting it down
-   light a fire inside the pot so you can warm yourself on a ship, or on
    flooded ground
-   place the pot upside down over a candle (leaving a gap for airflow), and
    place in a doorway;  
    if anyone tries to move it, you'll hear their cry of pain

The Guide should be **forgiving** about a plan's chance to succeed,  
and **upfront** about the risks involved.
