title: Introduction
---

**Norðland** is a fictional fantasy Iceland where survival is tough.  
Sweeping fjords, hot springs, & lush valleys,  
but also volcanic eruptions, frozen tundras, and dark dangerous woods.

## Who Are The Player Characters?

**Yesterday**, the players could have been anyone (jarl, thrall, warrior,
priest, sailor, smith...),  
but life is unfair and they were in an ultimately futile situation.  
**Today** they break free of their old life and go adventuring instead!

## What Adventures Can They Have?

Here are some sources of drama and conflict the players can get involved in.

###### Dwarven Megastructures

Below ground lie the cathedral-like halls of _Niðavellir_, carved by the
dwarves.  
Guarded by automata & nameless monsters below, filled with
[relics](/rules/magic/dwarven-relics) & artistic masterpieces.  
The dwarves hid every entrace so they'd be undisturbed. Some say the dug all the
way to [Hel](/setting/norðland-in-detail/#other-important-beings).

###### Invaders

The Holy Empire of Asculum wants to replace all cultures with worhsip of _The
Light_.  
Communities were torn apart when priests came in good faith and converted
many.  
Now an army of crusaders and exoricsts interrogate & baptise captives.

###### Kings & Jarls

The ruling class often hires mercenaries to protect settlements from existential
threats,  
strangers & schemers, and their own Shakespearean dramas.  
They pay well, but it's messy politics: alliances are fragile and you often must
choose a side.

###### The Wilderness

Monstrous predators prowl, savage populations target human settlements,  
exposure, disease, toxic plants, shifting glacial plans & volcanic eruptions.  
Nature is pressing & constant threat, which often complicates other conflicts.

###### Exiles

Honourless scavengers & bandits, shunned from their own communities.  
Their leaders have some item or ability to give them an edge.  
Desperate and unstable, they favour high-risk gambits.

###### Mythical Creatures

Werewolves, trolls, giants, serpentine dragons, and more.  
They act according to their nature, and usually want an easy meal or to protect
their lair.

###### Viking Warbands

Exploring new lands for trade, raids & adventure by joining a band or starting
your own.  
Some are institutions, their members famous celebrities.  
Experienced bands offer maps and knowledge of far lands for coin.

## What Is Society Like?

Norðland is a formalised, diverse, and violent Iron Age society.  
Here are some intuitions to make it feel distinct from generic fantasy:

###### Social Structure

-   The family, or clan, is the social unit, and most settlements have a single
    ruling clan
-   Social classes:
    -   **Jarls** are the wealthy class, with "The Jarl" being the ruler of a
        settlement
    -   **Karls** are the working class of subsistence farmers & skilled
        tradespeople
    -   **Thralls** are the lower class of servents, prisoners, and the
        disgraced

###### Individuals Over Institutions

-   People are loyal to a ruler, not "the crown" or "the country".
-   No taverns: people drink & socialise at each other's homes.
-   Trades are practiced by families, not guilds.

###### No Bureaucracy

-   Silver is valued by weight. Coins aren't minted, just a standard weight.
-   No mayor, no town guard; the _jarl_ publicly settles legal disputes,  
    taking advice from both witnesses and the Lawspeaker.
-   The injured party & their family is expected to enforce the punishment
    decided by the jarl.

###### Speech Over Writing

-   Send a messenger, not a letter.
-   Laws, contracts, genealogies & poems are all memorised,  
    often by specialists like the Lawspeaker.
-   Writing is intimate & informal; used for graffiti, memorials, and magic
    rituals.

###### Gangster-Style Politics

The jarl is similar to a mob boss:

-   feared & respected
-   uses diplomacy to avoid full-blown blood feuds
-   does **not** have the luxury of letting insults go unpunished

The difference is that the jarl is usually elected,  
adding a thin layer of ceremony that insulates society  
from pure might-makes-right rule.

### Code Of Honour

Everyone is held to this code.

###### Don't Be A Coward

-   introduce yourself, state your business plainly, resolve matters publicly
-   avenge any harm or insult done to you or your clan
-   never resort to gossip, lying, ambush or trickery

###### Deal Fairly

-   keep your word because oaths are sacred
-   be careful challenging those of a different social status:
    -   Punching up is bold but risky; you might be dismissed as arrogant
    -   Punching down is safe but shameful; you might be seen as a bully

###### Show Hospitality

-   provide food & shelter to someone who asks for it
-   good guests arrive with a token gift, and never stay too long
