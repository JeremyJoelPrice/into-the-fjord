You are Wounded when you are [attacked](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage/) and
fail your **Might** roll.

-   you drop everything that isn't weightless
-   you can can only crawl weakly until you get help & rest  
    _(See [Resting & Healing](rules/resting-and-healing/))_

If your attacker rolled the **maximum value** on their damage dice,  
you instead receive a Special Wound.

## Special Wounds

Lookup how much Might damage you took to see which Special Wound you get.  
Special Wounds recover differently, and you come back **stronger** afterwards.

_A lucky hit knocks you out._  
Next round roll Might to wake up.  
On recovery: roll 1d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new
max.

**3-4**  
_A heavy blow leaves a lasting scar._  
On recovery: roll 1d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new
max.

**5-6**  
_Your flesh is torn apart and blood soaks your clothes._  
You gain a [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue).  
On recovery: roll 2d6; if it's higher than your max Guard, it becomes your new
max.

**7-8**  
_Fractured bones leave you semi-conscious._  
You are [Deprived](/rules/deprivation) until you get a full night's rest.  
On recovery: roll 3d6; if it's higher than your max Grace, it becomes your new
max.

**9-10**  
_Your guts are hanging out, your wakefulness flickers._  
Deprived & crippled until you get a full night's rest & a skilled healer.  
On recovery: roll 3d6; if it's higher than your max Will, it becomes your new
max.

|     |          |     |           |
| --- | -------- | --- | --------- |

limb.
