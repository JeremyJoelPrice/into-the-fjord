title: Deprivation
---

A character is **Deprived** if a crucial need is not met:

-   hunger & thirst
-   warmth
-   rest
-   any addictions or magical compulsions the suffer from

Deprived characters do not benefit from any
[Resting & Healing](/rules/resting-and-healing),  
until their crucial need is met again.

## Optional Survival Rules

For those who prefer urgency and consequences tied to basic survival needs.

### Food, Water & Rest

Everybody needs **food**, **water**, and **rest**.  
If you lack any one of them, you suffer escalating [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue):

|          |            |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Day 1    | Deprived   |
| Next day | +1 Fatigue |
| Next day | +2 Fatigue |
| Next day | +3 Fatigue |
| Next day | +4 Fatigue |

When you cannot take any more Fatigue, you take damage to your
[Ability scores](/rules/ability-scores).

| Need  | Daily Requirement                                                       | Ability Damage   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Food  | 1 trail ration or 1 solid meal (~0.5kg)                                 | 1d6 Might damage |
| Water | 1 litre or 4 [seal bladders](/character-creation/gear#outdoor-survival) | 1d6 Grace damage |
| Rest  | 8 hours of rest, 4 of which must be unbroken sleep                      | 1d6 Will damage  |

### Exposure

Going out in the bitter cold can be deadly.

-   After the first **interval** you become Deprived until you warm up again
-   Every subsequent interval, you take **1d6 Grace** damage
-   At 0 you fall **unconscious** and will die in 1d6 hours\*

| temperature         | interval |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Cold (below 10º)    | 3 hours  |
| Freezing (below 0º) | 1 hour   |
| Deadly (below -10º) | 1 minute |

If you're wet or undressed, it counts as one **colder**.  
If you have a winter cloak, it counts as one **warmer**.

Mild temperatures (10º - 20ª) won't harm you, but won't help if you're already
deprived.
