title: Galdr
---

Galdr is the more respectable magic, often performed by warriors before
battle.  
Loud and confrontational, it challenges nature to submit to the will of the
caster.

Galdr is performed by chanting, singing, and ritual movements.  
Performing galdr adds [Fatigue](/rules/fighting/fatigue), and you need:

-   A strong voice and a free hand
-   Concentration; if casting **quietly** or **under stress**, roll Will to
    avoid a **misfire**
-   A [galdr staff](/character-creation/gear/#specialist--cultural-items), or a
    **perfect** memorisation, of the desired spell

If you want to **change** how a spell works or extend it's effects in some
way,  
make an additional Will roll to avoid a misfire.
