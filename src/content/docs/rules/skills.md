Sometimes success is just a matter of your character's knowledge and ability,  
and there are no **tactical** or **creative** decisions for a player to make.

Use a [Fate Roll](/start-here/how-to-play/#fate-roll) to see how well your
character performs in such cases.

## Skilled Hirelings

You always have the option to hire skilled NPCs to travel with you.  
They have some trade-offs:

-   PRO: They generally succeed without needing a Fate Roll,  
    unless they're in danger
-   PRO: They are generally Excellent (+3) or better at their specialty  
    _(because they're not good at much else)_
-   CON: They need feeding & protecting
-   CON: As non-combatants, they tend to flee from danger
