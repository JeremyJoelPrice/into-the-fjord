title: How To Play
---

One player is the **Guide**, who runs the game.  
You are in charge of describing the game world and interpreting the rules.

Everyone else
[creates a character](/character-creation/how-to-create-a-character) to play.  
Your characters work together as a team to achieve their goals.

**Normal play** is a conversation:

-   The Guide describes the situation, and asks: _"What do you do?"_
-   The players ponder, discuss & ask questions
-   Players tell the Guide what they do
-   The Guide might ask you to roll some dice
-   The Guide describes the outcome of your actions,  
    how the situation has changed, and then it's back to: _"What do you do?"_

_See [Example Of Play](/start-here/example-of-play)._

## Rolling Dice

We use dice to represent uncertainty, chaos, and luck in the shared fictional
world.  
**1d6** means roll one six-sided die. Likewise **2d6**, **1d8**, etc.

There are **three** kinds of roll:

1. [**Damage Rolls**](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage/) are used when you
   attack someone with your weapon.
2. [**Ability Rolls**](/rules/ability-scores#rolling-abilities) are used to
   avoid harm in hazardous situations.
3. [**Fate Rolls**](#fate-roll) are used in every other case (see below).

### Fate Roll

-   Roll 2d6, trying to get a 7 or higher to succeed.
-   If both dice match, the result is **extreme**.
-   Failure can also mean success at a cost, Guide's choice.

#### How To Use Fate Rolls

It's common and normal for the Guide to make impromptu dice rolls  
to answer questions both dramatic and mundane.

It helps to avoid bias and decision fatigue,  
and this is the niche Fate Rolls fill.

The Guide sets the chance of success by choosing a **bonus** (see below).

Does it feel like the players have a _Good_ chance of succeed,  
or does it feel more like a _Fair_ chance?  
Pick the description that resonates, and use its bonus.

| bonus          | chance of success |
| -------------- | ----------------- |
| Excellent (+3) | 92%               |
| Great (+2)     | 83%               |
| Good (+1)      | 72%               |
| Fair (+0)      | 58%               |
| Poor (-1)      | 42%               |
| Grim (-2)      | 28%               |
| Terrible (-3)  | 17%               |

_if the player is rolling a skill they're trained in,_  
_they'll already have their bonus written on the character sheet._

#### Example

Helga wants to reach an island, and avoid pirates on the way.  
Helga is Great (+2) at sailing, and has a ship with a ready crew.

The Guide asks for a Fate Roll.  
She rolls 2d6 and gets 5, +2 for her skill makes 7: success!.  
Her ship arrives safely.
