title: Dwarven Relics
---

The dwarves made many wondrous gifts for the gods, such as Thor's hammer
Mjölnir.  
More relics are found in their abandoned halls, and are highly prized.

**Black Candle**  
Think of an emotional memory while lighting this candle;  
that emotion is contagious to all who feel its heat.

**Disembodied Head**  
This head can talk, answer questions, and have its own thoughts.  
Magically preserved, it doesn't eat or sleep.

In most cases this lifestyle leads to mild insanity,  
but it all depends on whose head this is.

**Feathered Cloak**  
Wearer takes the form of an eagle.  
Your clothing & gear are with you when you turn back.  
Changing too often is tiring, and may incur [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue/).

**Dragon Rope**  
On command, this rope is fixed in place with the strength of 9 men.  
The rest of the time it is like a living serpent; it wants sleep,  
sunlight, and prey to chase. If angered it lashes out causing rope burn.

**Flying Weapon**  
When thrown, this weapon strikes true & returns to your hand.  
It can hit 1 extra target for each consecutive Grace roll you make,  
but on failure it embeds itself somewhere and sends hazardous debris flying.

Roll damage separately for each target.

**Gale Bladder**  
When first opened, this bladder consumes some of the current weather.  
This doesn't end the current weather.

When next opened, this bladder releases the stored weather  
in the general direction you point it, for up to an hour.

**Golden Apple**  
When eaten, you are immediately healthy, warm, well-rested & one year younger.  
These are especially rare.

**Hel-Horn**  
When sounded over a corpse or a gravesite;  
the deceased returns as an after-walker.

The target, and Hel herself, find this annoying & inconvenient.  
Ends when the after-walker chooses to return to their grave.

**Oath-Hand**  
This metal hand can crush bones, climb sheer surfaces, & punches for 1d8 damage.

However, anything complex or coordinated (like fighting)  
requires a Grace roll, or you crush whatever you're holding.

Your hand must be removed, and this relic grafted in its place.

**Pocket Ship**  
When empty of cargo & crew, this ship folds away into your pocket.

**Song-Key**  
This brass bell with no clapper can capture any sound.  
When you "ring" the bell, the sound is released as physical force.

Mostly this creates subtle vibrations,  
because Dwarven doors can only be opened by the correct sound.

Powerful or magical sounds will create more dramatic effects,  
see the table below for inspiration.
