title: Unit
---

A unit is anything **larger** or **more abstract** than a human,  
but which is handled by the rules as **one** character.  

So units should be in one place at a time, take one action in a fight,  
and generally function like a single being.

Examples:
- a group of NPCs
- a raging fire
- a single enormous monster

## Creating Units

Units can have:
- Abilities (if they can withstand or reactively avoid harm)
- Guard (if they can actively avoid harm)
- Armour (if they can passively resist harm)
- Damage dice (if they can inflict harm)
- Skills
- and anything else a regular character might have

By default:
- Player attacks are [impaired](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage#special-attacks) or outright useless against a unit,  
and players might need to figure out **how** to harm it before they can.
- Unit attacks are likewise [enhanced](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage#special-attacks) against players

See [Creating Monsters](/rules/creating-monsters) for advice on assigning concrete numbers to units.
