title: Seiðr
---

Seiðr is the less respectable magic.  
It deals with dreams, necromancy, disease, the weather, fertility & the harvest.

Except for the gift of [Prophecy](#prophecy), seiðr is generally not available
to player characters.  
Instead, the Guide is encouraged to use seiðr:

-   to deliver **information**, **clues**, or **warnings** to the players
-   to provide a way to cure/cause lycanthropy, vampirism, & other afflictions
-   to empower evil sorcerers to:
    -   tyranise & manipulate people
    -   raise the dead
    -   summon mythical threats

## Prophecy

To speak a prophecy, first take a dose of
[Trance Plant](/character-creation/gear-tables/#herbal--medicinal).

Then, compose a multiple-choice or yes/no question for the Guide to truthfully
answer.  
It must be:

-   About the near future, but not the outcome of a conflict (for that is Odin's
    domain)
-   Simple (no "ands", "buts", or run-on sentences)
-   Vague (no names, numbers or exactitudes)

Example prophetic questions:

-   "does our host have ill intent towards us?"
-   "if we approach the bandits, will they attack us immediately?"
-   "if we enter the woods, will we find shelter, danger, both, or something
    else?"
