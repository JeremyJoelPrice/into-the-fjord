Your Ability Scores represent how well you **avoid** harm,  
and how much you can **endure** before falling unconscious or dying.

## Rolling Abilities

Roll 1d20 and get a number **equal to or below** your Ability Score to succeed.

A result of **1** always succeeds, a **20** always fails.

## Opposed Rolls

If and your opponent are **both at risk**,  
then you both roll.

The winner is whoever succeeds by a **greater** margin.  
If it's a tie, the **larger score** wins.

## Advice For The Guide

Ability Rolls only happen when you call for them.  
You have to decide three things:

-   [Is time for a roll](#when-to-roll)?
-   [Which Ability should be rolled](#which-ability-to-roll)?
-   What's the [difficulty & danger](#difficulty--danger) of what the players
    are attempting?

Always **tell your players** what you decide,  
so they know the stakes **before they act**.

### When To Roll

-   If there is a risk of direct harm **OR**
-   If there is a risk of the situation becoming even more dangerous **OR**
-   If the players lack the **time**, **gear**, or **skill** to methodically
    achieve their goal

...then it is a good time to roll!

Use the table above to determine which Ability to roll,  
and which Ability takes the harm.

### Difficulty & Danger

The more **difficult** a task is, the **less you achieve** when you succeed.  
The more **dangerous** a task is, the **more it costs** when you fail.

#### Example

Three players want to climb a **treacherous cliffside**.

-   The **difficulty** is the size & scalability of the cliff
-   The **danger** is getting injured by falling

Suppose the players are able-bodied & have climbing gear,  
but are hurrying because there are enemy soldiers nearby.

-   One enemy is at the top of the cliff, and pours **oil** down onto Player A
-   A second enemy waits below with a spear, ready to **impale** Player B if
    they fall
-   Player C wears a pair of **spiked boots**, to make climbing faster & easier

The Guide might handle it like this:

**PLAYER A** is covered in oil. This makes the climb more **difficult**, but not
more **dangerous**.  
**Success**: only make it halfway up the cliff, and must roll again to
continue.  
**Failure**: the painful fall.

**PLAYER B** gets stabbed if they fall. This makes it more **dangerous**, but
not more **difficult**.  
**Success**: reach the top.  
**Failure**: they get hurt once for the fall, and once again for the spear.

**PLAYER C** has spiked boots. This makes it less **difficult**, but no less
**dangerous**.  
**Success**: speed to the top, with enough time to act again before the enemies
can.  
**Failure**: the painful fall.
