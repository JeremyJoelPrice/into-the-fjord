title: Deprivation
---

A character is **Deprived** if a crucial need is not met:

- hunger & thirst
- warmth
- rest
- addictions or magical compulsions

Deprived characters do not benefit from any
[Resting & Healing](/rules/resting-and-healing),  
until their crucial need is met again.

## Food, Water & Rest (Optional Rule)

Everybody needs **food**, **water**, and **rest**.  
If you lack any one of them, you suffer escalating [Fatigue](/rules/fatigue):

|          |            |
| -------- | ---------- |
| Day 1    | Deprived   |
| Next day | +1 Fatigue |
| Next day | +2 Fatigue |
| Next day | +3 Fatigue |
| Next day | +4 Fatigue |

When you cannot take any more Fatigue, you take damage to your
[Ability scores](/rules/ability-scores).

| Need  | Daily Requirement                                                       | Ability Damage   |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Food  | 1 trail ration or 1 solid meal (~0.5kg)                                 | 1d6 Might damage |
| Water | 1 litre or 4 [seal bladders](/character-creation/gear#outdoor-survival) | 1d6 Grace damage |
| Rest  | 8 hours of rest, 4 of which must be unbroken sleep                      | 1d6 Will damage  |
