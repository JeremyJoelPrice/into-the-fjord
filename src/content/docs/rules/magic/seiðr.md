title: Seiðr
---

Seiðr is the less respectable magic. Dark, mysterious, and prophetic.  
It has a specific social niche where it is tolerated.  
Practioners are called **seiðkona**, witches or sorcerers.

Except for the gift of [Prophecy](#prophecy) (see below), seiðr is generally not
available to player characters.  
Instead, the Guide is encouraged to use seiðkona in the following ways:

-   to deliver **information**, **clues**, or new **plot threads** to the player
    characters
-   to **disrupt** the social order with warnings or calls to action
-   to create the kinds of problems player characters can **solve**, like:
    -   raising the dead
    -   summoning mythical threats
    -   tyranising & manipulating people

Effects include divination, illusions, necromancy, and curses/blessings to
things like the harvest, fertility, the weather.

## Prophecy

The player characters can learn this ability.

-   it incurs [Fatigue](/rules/fighting/fatigue)
-   it takes an hour's ritual to perform

Compose a multiple-choice or yes/no question for the Guide to truthfully
answer.  
It must be:

-   About the near future, but not the outcome of a battle (for that is Odin's
    domain)
-   Simple (no "ands", "buts", or run-on sentences)
-   Vague (no names, numbers or exactitudes)
-   examples:
    -   "if we enter the woods, will we find shelter, danger, both, or something
        else?"
    -   "does our host have ill intent?"
    -   "if we approach the bandits, will they attack us immediately?"
