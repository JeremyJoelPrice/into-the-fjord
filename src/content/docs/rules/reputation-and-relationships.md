## Reputation

Your reputation matters when dealing with others.  
Make a [Push Roll](/start-here/how-to-play#push-roll) when you:

-   introduce yourself & make a first impression
-   ask a stranger for a favour
-   you're on trial and need someone to vouch for you

Your reputation starts at Mediocre (0).  
It goes up when you do anything which increases your fame and honour.  
It goes down when you act dishonourably or suffer a humiliating defeat.

## Relationships

Relationships work the same as Reputation,  
but they are tracked individually instead.  
When dealing with someone you have a relationship score for,  
you still make a Push Roll but you use their score instead of your reputation
score.

Only your 5 most important relationships deserve to be tracked.

You might have a Poor(-1) reputation, but a Great(+3) relationship with _this_
person.

Use Reputation for everyone else.
