title: Reputation
---

These are some examples of when your reputation really matters:

-   asking someone to take your word on trust
-   you're on trial and need someone to vouch for you
-   to pressure/inspire others to follow & obey you

When the Guide needs to know how an NPC sees you,  
make a [Fate Roll](/start-here/how-to-play/#fate-roll) with your reputation
bonus.

**Success** means:

-   your reputation is _well-deserved_ if good, or _undeserved_ if bad
-   you are generally honourable and authoritative

**Failure** means:

-   your reputation is _undeserved_ if good or _well-deserved_ if bad
-   you are generally suspicous and unpredictable

### Gaining & Losing Reputation

People hold each other to a
[Code of Honour](/setting/introduction/#code-of-honour),  
but sometimes the best way to achieve a goal is underhanded.

Witnesses (such as companion NPCs) will **always** spread the word,  
and what they say changes your reputation.

If you've done something **heroic**:

-   their words will improve your reputation
-   the best witnesses are enemies you allow to escape

If you've done something **dishonourable**:

-   their words will count against you
-   even your friends will tell the truth about you,  
    both as a mark of respect and because lying is a serious offence

If there are **no witnesses** at all:

-   your reputation will not change
-   more savvy NPCs will see this as a lack of accountability

### False Witnesses

It is **very hard** to maintain a lie across more than 3 or 4 people.

Folks are **natural experts** at sensing when something's off,  
because witness testimony is a central pillar of society,  
and lying can be punishable by death.

Accounts that are **too similar** or **too different** are equally suspicious,  
and everyone has plenty of experience in spotting when things don't add up.
