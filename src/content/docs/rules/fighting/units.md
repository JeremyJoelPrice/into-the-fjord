title: "Unit"
---

A unit is anything **larger** or **more abstract** than a human,  
but which is still treated as **one** character.

Units should function like a single being,  
like being in one place at a time,  
and taking one action in a fight.

Examples:

-   a large group of NPCs
-   a raging fire
-   a swarm of tiny creatures

Player attacks are typically
[impaired](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage#special-attacks) or outright
useless against a unit,  
 and players might need to figure out **how** to harm it before they can.

Likewise, a unit's attacks are probably
[enhanced](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage#special-attacks) against
players,  
unless there's a good reason they shouldn't be.

## Creating Units

Units can have:

-   Abilities (if they can withstand or reactively avoid harm)
-   Guard (if they can actively avoid harm)
-   Armour (if they can passively resist harm)
-   Damage dice (if they can inflict harm)
-   Skills
-   and anything else a regular character might have

See [Creating Monsters](/rules/creating-monsters) for advice on assigning
concrete numbers to units.
