## Let's Face It: Characters Die

There are a number of attitudes a player might have about losing their
character:

-   Some players are protective of their characters and enjoy when they thrive &
    succeed
-   Some players drive their characters like a stolen car, embracing chaos &
    consequences
-   Some players treat their characters as just a game token to be used
    carefully & tactically
-   Some players want to see their character's personality & flaws influence the
    story

If any of these resonate, tell your fellow players!  
Understanding how you relate to your characters will help you have fun
**together**.

## As A Player You Should Care About:

-   **Having A Plan**  
    What do you want to acheive?  
    Is it worth stepping back and approaching this differently?

-   **Gear**  
    Every bit of gear you carry has its use, but space is limited.

-   **Investigating**  
    Knowledge is power so check under the bed, read that book,  
    ask that merchant what he knows about your next destination.

## As The Guide You Should Care About:

-   **Neutrality**  
    It's ok for the players to have a triumphant victory or a crushing defeat.  
    Be true to the world, it's NPCs, and the whims of the dice.

-   **Giving Information**  
    Fun comes from tricky situations, not from player ignorance.  
    Always give them useful answers, a free clue, and telegraph danger

-   **NPCs**  
    Play each one according to their desires & ability to get what they want.  
    Each NPC is the hero of their own story, and they intend to win.

## How To Think About Gear

Everything your character is carrying is for **solving problems** in
**creative** or **clever** ways.

Get into this mindset by thinking of items in terms of what they **are**, not
what they're **for**.  
For example, a simple **cooking pot**:

-   may smell of food, so you could attract a hungry animal
-   is somewhat resonant when struck, so you could send a signal at a distance
-   can withstand high temperatures, so you could light a fire inside to warm
    you on wet/flooded ground

The Guide should be **forgiving** about a plan's chance to succeed,  
and **upfront** about the risks involved.
