title: Seiðr
---

Seiðr is the less respectable magic, dealing with  
dreams, necromancy, disease, the weather, fertility & the harvest.

It is generally not available to player characters.  
Instead, the Guide is encouraged to use seiðr:

- to deliver **information**, **clues**, or **warnings** to the players
- to manage mystical curses such as lycanthropy or vampirism
- to empower evil sorcerers to manipulate people, or summon mythical threats

## Prophecy

Unless you gifted with prophecy, you must be taught this ability by a mentor.

**To speak a prophecy**:

1. Take a dose of
   [Fly Agaric](/character-creation/gear-tables/#herbal--medicinal)
2. Compose a multiple-choice or yes/no question

3. The Guide will answer your question truthfully,  
   using the choices you provided

**Question must be**:

- About the near future, but not the outcome of a conflict (that is Odin's
  domain)
- Simple - no "ands", "buts" or run-on sentences
- Vague - no names, numbers or exactitudes

**Examples**:

- "does our host have ill intent towards us?"
- "if we approach the bandits, will they attack us immediately?"
- "if we enter the woods, will we find shelter, danger, both, or something
  else?"
