title: Turns & Actions
---

When a fight breaks out, we take **turns**.

-   Players who succeed a **Will** roll go first
-   Then all opponents act
-   Then **all** players act

Continue alternating sides until the fight is over.

## Actions

On the players' turn, you each take **one** action,  
plus any supporting actions or movement.

Your characters act **simultaneously**, so coordinate your actions together.  
**All** dice are rolled after **every** character commits to an action.

Example actions:

-   attacking someone with a weapon
-   disengaging from an enemy & creating space between you
-   fishing something out of your backpack

Your [Guard](/rules/fighting/guard) is effectively 0 if you take your eyes off
your opponent,  
so avoid drinking a potion or rummaging in your backpack during a fight.

## Space & Movement

Don't bother with exact measurements of distance,  
though a rough map is helpful for keeping track of a fight.

Instead use broad terms like:

-   **Within reach**, if two characters are in striking distance
-   **Close**, if you can approach & attack them in one turn
-   **Far**, if you can't approach & attack, but can shoot them
-   **Distant**, if a ranged weapon would struggle to even hit them

## Reacting

If you're within reach of an opponent,  
and they're is neither under attack nor preoccupied,  
they can interfere with the your action  
(and vice versa!)

They might make it difficult or impossible to complete your action,  
or deal
[impaired (d4) damage](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage#special-attacks) to
you, or something else as appropriate.
