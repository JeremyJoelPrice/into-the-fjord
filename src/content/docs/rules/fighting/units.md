title: "Unit"
---

A unit is anything **larger** or **more abstract** than a human,  
but which is still treated as **one** character.

Examples:

-   a large group of NPCs
-   a raging fire
-   a swarm of tiny creatures

Players usually need to figure out **how** to harm a unit effectively;  
attacks may be [impaired](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage#special-attacks) or
outright useless until they do.

Likewise, a unit's attacks are probably
[enhanced](/rules/fighting/attacks-and-damage#special-attacks) against players.

## Creating Units

Give your units any or all of the following, as needed:

-   Abilities (if they can withstand or avoid harm)
-   Guard (if they can protect themselves)
-   Armour (if they are resistant to damage)
-   Damage dice (if they can inflict harm)
-   Skills (to highlight whatever they're effective at)
-   Any special or unique abilities
