title: Introduction
---

**Norðland** is a fictional fantasy Iceland where survival is tough.  
Sweeping fjords, hot springs, & lush valleys,  
but also volcanic eruptions, frozen tundras, and mysterious woods.

## Who Are The Player Characters?

Normal people who live outside of normal societal roles.  
Damaged & out of options, they make a final push for glory & victory.

## What Adventures Can They Have?

Here are some sources of drama and conflict the players can get involved in.

###### Dwarven Megastructures

Below ground lie the abandoned halls of _Niðavellir_.  
Cathedral-like and filled with magical [relics](/rules/magic/dwarven-relics),
artistic masterpieces,  
and twisted automata made of iron and corpse-flesh.

###### Invaders

Crusaders of _The Light_ want to replace all other cultures.  
Priests came first, helping people and gently sharing their faith.  
Now an army is here, interrogating & baptising captives.

###### Kings & Jarls

The ruling class often hires mercenaries to protect settlements  
from existential threats, and their own Shakespearean dramas.  
They pay well, but alliances are fragile and you often must choose a side.

###### The Rot

It's failed crops and rabid animals.  
It's monstrous mutations, wasting diseases.  
It's a fearful hatred that infests hearts & minds.

###### Exiles

Bandits & scavengers, exiled from their own communities.  
Desperate and unstable, they favour high-risk gambits,  
and most would leave it behind if they had another option.

###### Mythical Creatures

The werewolf curse can spread with a bite.  
Trolls are guardians and embodiments of natural places.  
Giants destroy huamn settlements every time they learn of one.

###### Viking Warbands

Explore new lands for trade, raids & adventure by joining a band or starting
your own.  
Some are institutions, their members famous celebrities.  
Retired bands offer maps and knowledge of far lands for coin.

## What Is Society Like?

Norðland is a formalised, diverse, and violent Iron Age society.  
Here are some intuitions to make it feel distinct from other times & places:

###### Clan As The Social Unit

-   Their family, or clan, is a central part of a person's identity &
    reputation.  
    Most settlements have a single ruling clan
-   Social classes:
    -   **Jarls** are the wealthy class, with "The Jarl" being the ruler of a
        settlement
    -   **Karls** are the working class of subsistence farmers & skilled
        tradespeople
    -   **Thralls** are the lower class of servents, prisoners, and the
        disgraced

###### Individuals Over Institutions

-   People are loyal to a ruler, not "the crown" or "the country".
-   No taverns: people drink & socialise at
    [each other's homes](#show-hospitality).
-   Trades are practiced by families, not guilds.

###### No Bureaucracy

-   Silver is valued by weight. Coins aren't minted, just a standard weight.
-   No mayor, no town guard; the _jarl_ publicly settles legal disputes,  
    taking advice from both witnesses and the Lawspeaker.
-   The injured party & their family is expected to enforce the punishment
    decided by the jarl.

###### Speech Over Writing

-   Send a messenger, not a letter.
-   Laws, contracts, genealogies & poems are all memorised,  
    often by specialists like the Lawspeaker.
-   Writing is intimate & informal; used for graffiti, memorials, and magic
    rituals.

###### Legal Violence vs Informal Peacekeeping

-   Insults should be repaid in blood
-   Holmgangs (duels) can settle legal matters
-   Fearsome warriors can act with impunity, since few challenge them

In practice, however, most folks want peace & order,  
and would rather pretend an insult wasn't truly meant that way.

###### Gangster-Style Politics

The jarl is similar to a mob boss:

-   feared & respected
-   uses diplomacy to avoid full-blown blood feuds
-   does **not** have the luxury of letting insults go unpunished

### Code Of Honour

Everyone is held to this code.

###### Show Hospitality

-   provide food & shelter to someone who asks for it
-   good guests arrive with a token gift, and never stay too long

###### Don't Be A Coward

-   introduce yourself, state your business plainly, resolve matters publicly
-   avenge any harm or insult done to you or your clan
-   never resort to gossip, lying, ambush or trickery

###### Deal Fairly

-   keep your word because oaths are sacred
-   be careful challenging those of a different social status:
    -   Punching up is bold but risky; you might be dismissed as arrogant
    -   Punching down is safe but shameful; you might be seen as a bully
