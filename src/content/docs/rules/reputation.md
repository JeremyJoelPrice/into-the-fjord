title: Reputation
---

These are some examples of when your reputation really matters:

-   when introducing yourself to someone new
-   you're on trial and need someone to vouch for you
-   to pressure/inspire others to follow & obey you

When the Guide needs to know how an NPC sees you,  
make a [Fate Roll](/start-here/how-to-play/#fate-roll) + your reputation bonus.

**Success** means:

-   your reputation is _well-deserved_ if good, or _undeserved_ if bad
-   you are generally honourable and authoritative

**Failure** means:

-   your reputation is _undeserved_ if good or _well-deserved_ if bad
-   you are generally suspicous and unpredictable

### Reputation Isn't Fair

Because honuorable conduct is expected of everyone,  
it's easier to **lose** reputation than to **gain** it.

A heroic deed will boost you by one or two points,  
but you will lose **d4** points for:

-   lying
-   avoiding a fight
-   failing to avenge an insult

### Gaining & Losing Reputation

Witnesses (includeing companion NPCs) will **always** spread the word,  
and what they say changes your reputation.

If you've done something **heroic**:

-   their words will improve your reputation
-   the best witnesses are enemies you allow to escape

If you've done something **dishonourable**:

-   their words will count against you
-   assume even your friends will tell the truth about you

If there are **no witnesses** at all:

-   your reputation will not change
-   savvy NPCs will see this it a suspicious lack of accountability

### False Witnesses

Witness testimony is a central pillar of society & justice,  
and lying is punsihable by death.

Everyone knows that each story is a unique version of the same events,  
so accounts that are **too similar** or **too different** are equally
suspicious,  
and folks are **natural experts** at sensing when something's off.

This makes it **hard** to maintain a lie across several false witnesses.
