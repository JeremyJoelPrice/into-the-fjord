title: Skills

Sometimes there are no tactical or creative decisions for a player to make.  
Success is just a matter of your character's knowledge and ability:

-   Healing an injured ally
-   Crafting a magical weapon
-   Training a beast to serve you

Instead, use a [Fate Roll](/start-here/how-to-play/#fate-roll) to see how well
your character performs.

| Healing                               |

| Hunting & Trapping                    |

## Skilled Hirelings

You always have the option to hire skilled NPCs to travel with you.  
They have some trade-offs:

-   PRO: They generally succeed without needing a Fate Roll,  
    unless they're in danger
-   PRO: They are generally Excellent (+3) or better at their specialty  
    _(because they're not good at much else)_
-   CON: They need feeding & protecting
-   CON: As non-combatants, they tend to flee from danger
