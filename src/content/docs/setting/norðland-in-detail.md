## History of Norðland

After fleeing from the tyrant _Harald Stormcrown_, the free people of the North
discovered Norðland. The volcanic ashlands and frost-bitten tundras make most
parts uninhabitable, but the free people get by in scattered settlements,
seeking safety and a little prosperity.

Settlements are small and each is led by a Jarl. Laws are enforced by everyone,
through social pressure and custom. It’s a highly formal culture, where even
revenge killings must follow rules & tradition. Think Pride & Prejudice with
axes.

## Religion & Mythology

> _"I sacrifice to the gods because they give me victory in battle and a good
> harvest.  
> Simple as that. But this new religion?  
> They want loyalty. Devotion. Worship._  
> _I don’t give those things to anyone but my wife._  
> _And in return I get vague promises about the next life?  
> These priests of The Light need to make a better offer..."_

Norðlandrs revere the Aesir, a mythical family called "the gods".  
The Jötnar are a similar family, joined to the Aesir by marriage and divided by
war.  
The difference is the Aesir look kindly upon humans.

### The Main Gods

**Odin** - a god for the upper class. Wise, bloodthirsty, and ambitious. He
decides the outcomes of battles, and recruits slain warriors for his own army.

**Thor** - a god for the common people. Strong, brave, and true of heart. He is
the Aesir's greatest warrior, and thunder is the sound of his hammer striking
true.

**Frigg** - a goddess, the wife of Odin. Magical, prophetic, and a symbol of
motherhood. She knows the future and the wise listen.

### Other Important Beings

**Loki** - one of the Jötnar. Loki is a liar, a coward, and a troublemaker. At
Ragnarök he will betray the gods.

**Hel** - one of the Jötnar, she claims the dead left by Odin. At once alive and
dead, Hel is the gatekeeper of the grave. She rules a frosty realm below.

**Jörmungandr** - a serpent so large he encircles the earth. His every movement
shakes the ocean and floods the land. He is the equal of Thor.

**Fenrir** - a giant wolf betrayed by the gods. He is a father of monsters, and
the reason Odin is raising an army.

**The Norns** - mysterious beings who carve the fates of all into the bark of
Yggdrasil, the World Tree.

## Beyond Norðland

To the south there are 9 warring kingdoms.  
They all claim loyalty to the _Church of The Light_, and they all provide
tribute and soldiers.  
The _City of Asculum_ is the seat of the Church, and spreads The Light through
faith, coin, & bloodshed.

These southern lands are more developed: they have steel, castles of stone, and
occult magicks.  
They have even brought new dangers to Norðland: vampires, witches, demonic
possessions.  
But their people are smaller and weaker than the Norðlandrs, and they don’t
bathe as often.

There are many lands not yet discovered.
